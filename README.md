My partner, Semal Shah, and I, Brendan Thomas, created this website for the business, Spotts PC. Spotts PC is a repair store that has the capability of fixing numerous devices ranging from phones to computers. We both strive to be more technologically advanced than our current state and wish to use these skills to not only make a fine website, but to also go further.

Our website was created in order to allow people who are in need of the services of Spotts PC to be able to easily access a website filled with the necessary contents for the typical customer.

Website Features:

•	On our client’s original website, the content didn’t allow customers to place an appointment for Spotts PC’s service. We decided that being able to schedule appointments via website can create an easier flow of business. This also allows customers to state their device and problem, creating a moment of preparation for our client.

•	Spotts PC had numerous customer reviews that praised the business, but their original website didn’t use these reviews to promote their business. Our client, my partner, and I agreed that a page dedicated to how the customers viewed the business, if done right, would allow positive results for Spotts PC.

•	Our client had an interesting story on why and how the business first originated. We decided that the story could be put on to the website in the case of customers wanting to look at the background of Spotts PC.

•	Within the footer of the website, we created numerous links to easily allow the distribution of information. For example, we have links to their social medias, location on google maps, and pages of the website.

Thank you for taking the time to check out our website, we really appreciate it!
